Executive Order 9066 was a United States presidential executive order signed and issued during World War II by United States president Franklin D. Roosevelt on February 19, 1942. Though it purpoted to apply to Italians and Germans in the US as well, only a small portion of these populations were incarcerated in US-based camps. Far more Americans of Asian descent were forcibly interned than Americans of European descent, both in total and as a share of relative population. Forced to urgently leave their homes, many people sold their homes at an enormous loss and lost their businesses."},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.39875,37.79135]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":5,"chapter":"Manzanar Becomes a Historic Site Through Activism","zoom":20,"image":"img/previous_park_sign_CA_not_federal.jpg","source-credit":"Source: California Historic Landmark signage.

The U.S. gov- ernment manages this piece of land through the National Park Service, a bureau of the Department of the Interior. It is the same democratic government (although of course not the same administration) that in 1942 mandated the rapid incarceration of all Japanese Americans in the westernmost states, ripping people away from their homes and busi- nesses and confining them in tarpaper shacks under armed guard. During World War II, Japanese Americans were treated as enemies of the state solely based on racialized categories."},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.1551,36.7269]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":6,"chapter":"Manzanar Committee Activism","zoom":20,"image":"img/ManzanarPilgrimage.jpeg","source-credit":"Source: Wikimedia","source-link":"https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ManzanarPilgrimageInterfaith2002.jpg","description":"The Manzanar Pilgrimmage brings survivors and advocates together to the site to claim the right to voice this history from their perspective, not the state's.
