Roosevelt on February 19, 1942. Though it purpoted to apply to Italians and Germans in the US as well, only a small portion of these populations were incarcerated in US-based camps. Far more Americans of Asian descent were forcibly interned than Americans of European descent, both in total and as a share of relative population. Forced to urgently leave their homes, many people sold their homes at an enormous loss and lost their businesses."},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.39875,37.79135]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":5,"chapter":"Contrast with Hawaii Process Stalling","zoom":5,"image":"img/StateOfHawaiiNPS map_1.jpeg","source-credit":"Source: National Park Service, NPS.gov","source-link":"https://www.hawaiiinternment.org/students/internment-camps-hawai%E2%80%98i","description":"Hawaii, in contrast, incarcerated only a small portion of its enormous Japanese and Japanese-Americans population.

The U.S. gov- ernment manages this piece of land through the National Park Service, a bureau of the Department of the Interior. It is the same democratic government (although of course not the same administration) that in 1942 mandated the rapid incarceration of all Japanese Americans in the westernmost states, ripping people away from their homes and busi- nesses and confining them in tarpaper shacks under armed guard. During World War II, Japanese Americans were treated as enemies of the state solely based on racialized categories."},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.1551,36.7269]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":7,"chapter":"National Site vs State Site Problematics in Recognition of State Racism","zoom":16,"image":"img/04_narrative_panel_acknowledges_activists_role.png","source-credit":"Source: Interpretive Center narrative panel showing acknowledgment of the grassroots activist origins of Manzanar�s historic site designation.
